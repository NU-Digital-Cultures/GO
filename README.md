# GO
A "hello world" repo for students to practice / test with.
This is the first test.

## What is this?
This repo is simply a place holder for testing out github features for students in Digital Cultures. It can be cloned and edited without any serious consideration of things 'breaking.'


## Week 6 Tasks
### First Task
1. Go to "Issues" above.
2. Find the "Can't do this alone" issue.
3. Add a comment with your username, so I will have a record of everyone's usernames.

### Second Task
1. Select someone from your group to create a repository for your group.
2. Create a new repository within the NU Digital Cultures Github Community
3. Make sure that everyone on your team can access it from their accounts.
4. Edit the readme.md to add a brief, preliminary overview of what your project will be.

### Third Task
1. Go to the "Projects" area.
2. Create a new project for your group associated with the repo you just created.
3. Develop a preliminary outline for how you are going to build your project (to be completed by following week).

### Fourth Task
Go back to the beginning and figure out why VSCode and Github GUI are acting so badly.
