# GO
A "hello world" repo for students to practice / test with.
This is the first test.

## What is this?
This repo is simply a place holder for testing out github features for students in Digital Cultures. It can be cloned and edited without any serious consideration of things 'breaking.' Even though things have clearly already broken.

It is also where sample code and demonstration files are kept. Again, these are all for students to clone, copy or otherwise try out and use as guidelines.
