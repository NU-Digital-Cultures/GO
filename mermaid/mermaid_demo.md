# Using Mermaid.js to Brainstorm and Document

## Why This?
First, it is a good way to develop more markdown skills.

Second, while there are technically *faster* ways to make flowcharts and mindmaps, this tool is not dependent on one platform. You can copy and paste, email, post to github, work on the document off line, there are no user names required, anyone can collaborate. So, in short, what you trade in a slightly slower work flow and learning curve, you gain in openness. 

Third, it forces us to slow down and really think through connections, rather than haphazardly drawing (no put intended) conclusions.

## Getting Started
<https://mermaid.js.org/> is the main page.

But the live code might be the most useful in the moment, this is a real case of learn by doing:
