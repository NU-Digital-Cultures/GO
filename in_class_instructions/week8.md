# Week 8 When Problems Inevitably Arise
This week is all about acknowledging issues:
* technical
* conceptual 
* interpersonal 

## Technical Problems

1 Did you follow the instructions?
2 How do you explain the problem?
3 Can you find an explanation in the documentation?
4 What do search engines reveal?
    * Youtube
    * stack exchange
    * reddit
    * software specific forums

5 Who else can you ask?

## Conceptual Problems

1 Read!
2 Write.
3 Get feedback.
4 Repeat.

## Interpersonal 
1 _Why_ is something a problem? Can you articulate it?
2 What do you want the resolution to be and why?
3 Who do you need to talk with about it?

    i.e. Is someone not doing something the way you would? What are the consequences, can you live with them (give up some control) or do you need something to change for the sake of the project (assert accountability)?

# When projects don't go the way you planned
Hint, they rarely do.

Embrace the 'hacker' ethos for this module. We are not performing brain surgery, building a particle accelerator, or painting a masterpiece, it is okay if the final prototype does not look like or work the way you though it would this week. However, that doesn't you can throw in the towel, you need to revise your plan and *write down* what the new plan is.

# In Class Today

- [ ] Meet with you group.

- [ ] Confirm that you have a problem statement and/or research statement -- can you clearly articulate what your project is going to do?

- [ ] Add it to the main readme (front page) of your github repo.

- [ ] Review your repository. Is it organised, can everyone find what they need?

    - [ ] What do you need to add? Add it!
    - [ ] Do you need assistance? Ask for it.
    - [ ] Is everything in a folder or cloud drive somewhere? Take the time to organise it as a github repo.

- [ ] Do you have the software you need?
    - [ ] Can everyone access / run the tools they need?
    - [ ] Do you need assistance?

- [ ] Sources
    - [ ] Do you have the academic literature you need?
    - [ ] Is it organised ?
    - [ ] Do you have the data sources you need?

- [ ] What other problems are coming up that you are worried about?
    - [ ] are they written down?
    - [ ] do you have a plan to address them?

- do you have a realistic timeline? 
    - [ ] is it written down?
    - [ ] do you have a plan to check in and revise?

# April 23
Groups will present a "work in progress." The presentations will be structured around a pitch to either your partner organisation or possible funder for the project.

The goal will be to:
- clearly explain how your project addresses some part of the brief
- show off the progress of the project (you do not need it to be complete, but complete enough that someone can see how it will work)
- have an opportunity for your group to practice putting together and delivering a presentation before the assessed presentation two weeks later
- get feed back on your project
