# CODE

This folder contains all of the code and production files used in the project.

It is currently organized into:
* CSS - all of the stylesheets we are using for the app. mostly generated from the figma layout
* design_files - intermediary code between figma and swift, wireframes and demos
* html - portfolio website files, using md and jekyl
* js - javascript files related to the react.js version of the app
* swift - files for xcode to make an iOS app
